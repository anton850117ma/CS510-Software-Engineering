Main.java is a further enhanced bug detection tool. Besides the functionality of the bug detection tool in part A and part C, Main.java in part D has a fifth optional parameter called T_UPRATIO which means the UnPaired Ratio Threshold.

T_UPRATIO is passed as a integer in the range of 0 to 100. For example, if you want a 50% unpaired ratio threshold, you pass 50 as the fifth parameter into Main.

You can use command 'make' to compile the java code as the Makefile is implemented.

To execute the bug detection tool, use can either modify the verify.sh with a fifth argument passed into pipair or run the following command directly:

java Main <callgraph_path> [T_SUPPORT] [T_CONFIDENCE] [LEVEL] [T_UPRATIO]

LEVEL here means the depth of performing function inline(expansion of the scope) just the same as that of part C.
